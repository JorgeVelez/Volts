##Turing Mini Voltages Expander   

This is a simple, low-parts count, low-current expander for the Turing Machine Random Sequencer in 4HP. 

It acts like a variable 5-bit digital-to-analog converter, taking 5 bits from the Turing Machine GATES expansion port, running them through five potentiometers and giving one summed voltage output.   

Multiple mini expanders can be daisychained from one Turing sequencer to give melodically different outputs that are all related to (and change with) the main Turing sequence.   

Designed in one day while on holiday in Cornwall.   

Status:  
September 2015: First board validated idea, contained embarrassing errors. Those fixed, second prototypes ordered.  
August 2015: Awaiting first prototypes
